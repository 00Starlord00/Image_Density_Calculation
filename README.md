# Object Detection
  Welcome to the Object Classification Model repository! This project focuses on developing a robust object detection system to identify various objects within images and videos accurately. Leveraging the RetinaNet architecture, I achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 94.326% in detecting multiple objects simultaneously. This repository contains the codebase and documentation for replicating and extending our work.

# Models
  Before running the main script, you must download the models from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TNtiZDp_BjPAa9T7x1YiD3QcNTADgcrN?usp=sharing). The folder linked has three models:  
    1. __RetinaNet__ : _high performance and accuracy, with longer detection time_.    
    2. __YOLOv3__ : _moderate performance and accuracy, with a moderate detection time_.    
    3. __TinyYOLOv3__ : _optimized for speed and moderate performance, with fast detection time_.    
  

# Dataset
  The dataset contains two varieties, one containing high number of people in a crowd and other contains less number of people in a crowd. You can get the datasets from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1742Skp_6Vr6J3tk7Hrzb2uKHtZ0_XHJ7?usp=sharing). You can save the output files in the "Output" folder.
